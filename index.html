  			<h3 class="AboutmeTitle">About Me</h3>
  				<p class="biography">Hello! My name is Wesley Yates and I am currently enrolled as a student at UCF. My major is Ditigal media with my goal of being able to design my own games by the end of college. Ever since I was little, I have been interested in videogames, and my passion for them grew as I got older, now being interested in almost every aspect of them including gameplay, story, art, programing, character design, and music. I believe UCF has one of the best programs to learn game design and I am happy to have this opportunity to learn it!</p>



  			<h3 class="MyWorkTitle">My Work</h3>
  				<p class="mywork">In the future, I would love to be able to design video games on my own. I want to design interesting characters and implement a compelling story into games. Through the UCF Digital media program, the career I am aiming for is game development/design. I either want to join an established game development company or create a new one with friends.</p>
